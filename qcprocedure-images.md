# Quality Control Procedures for Digitized Documents


Quality control is important to verify that all Carnegie Hall Archives materials have been returned from the digitizing vendor and that digital files have been created properly.

## Original Documents

First, compare returned documents with original Excel spreadsheet of what was sent to the vendor. Make sure all documents are accounted for.

## Image Files

### Randomly check 10-25% of all files returned from the vendor for the following:

1.	File opens and displays
2.	Proper formats have been created (e.g. TIFs and JPGs)
3.	Check color mode (e.g. RGB)
4.	Check bit depth (e.g.48-bit for color)

### Compare file with original document:

5.	Confirm correct orientation (vertical vs. horizontal) and dimensions
6.	Is the image complete?
7.	Check spatial resolution (e.g. correct resolution, inches/cm)
8.	Is the image cropped properly?
9.	Are there any missing pages or images?

### Check for image quality:

10.	Tone (brightness, contrast)
11.	Is the color accurate?
12.	Are there any artifacts? (e.g. from dust, dropped out pixels, defects)
13.	Check for detail and sharpness
14.	Check for lighting/flare issues

### Metadata
15.	 Confirm that the file name is accurate and adheres to file naming convention
16.	 Check that embedded metadata exists and is accurate
17.	 Check metadata spreadsheet for completeness
